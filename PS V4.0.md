**Personal Statement**

In my early years, BBS always acted as an initial teacher in the Computer World. I learnt the first line of code via the tutorial of customization of Android firmware

Under the influence of my parents, who are both engineers, I grew up with a passionate interest in technology products. But it was a book named *Making a World of Difference: The Kaifu Lee Story* truly enlightened me to learn about computer science. Through the story of this great man, I saw the unique significance of computer science, which is the physical embodiment of human ingenuity and a ubiquitous force of limitless possibility. I took my first step of realizing my dream until entered Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications in 2014, a university features Information Technology, and could give me the free soil to build my dreams. Majoring in Computer Science, I’ve laid the basic foundation in this subject. And I was chosen as an exchange student to study at University of New South Wales(UNSW) Australia last year(2017), during which time I realized the in-depth study and research were appealing to me. Hence, I take the heart of grace to apply for your MSc in Information Technology. 

 

My undergraduate study at Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications was extremely fruitful, during which I was exposed to the professional knowledge of computer science and formed a good learning habit. My interests in this subject have given me the strong motivation to have the self-study and expand my knowledge scope. Due to the earnest attitude and constant efforts, I achieved the final average score of 83.5/100 and was granted the Bachelor’s Degree of Engineering this summer(2018). Moreover, the six months of exchange experience in UNSW refreshed my knowledge base and broadened my horizons. In Australia, I got the opportunity to experience the British-style education. To challenge myself, I also signed up for some of the graduate courses, such as *Information Retrieval* and *Web Search*, through which I acquired the basic knowledge on the advanced research in this area. In the course Web Application Engineering I got a high score of 95 while my homework was awarded as the Best Assignment in 2017-2018 S1, which were the proof of my hard work. Except for enriching my specialized knowledge, my English competence was also greatly improved, after which I’ve been able to conduct daily communication, learn the courses taught in English, and have been equipped with English terminology of computer science. On account of my excellent academic performance, I was also recommended to be a postgraduate student in UNSW upon my graduation, which is a great honor to me. 

 

Besides making efforts in courses, the participation in academic competitions and projects plays an important role in my study as well. In 2016. I took part in the Contemporary Undergraduate Mathematical Contest in Modeling, winning the First Prize. In addition, I attended and served as the team leader in various academic projects, through which I enhanced my ability to apply the textbook knowledge into practice. I set up a workshop with my friends and we made the first version of our online official App. We also undertook other projects through which I laid up a strong basic in programming. In 2016, I began to attend some research programs. For instance, I attended the project *Face Recognition with Dual Cameras Based on NAO Robot* as the team leader. Face Recognition was a common research project in computer science, while my innovation was to take advantage of the dual cameras in NAO robot to improve its precision of recognition. At first, I used SIFT algorithm to make the feature detection but the results obtained was not satisfactory. Even if I did all the preprocessing tasks, the precision rate is still low. After seeking advice from my mentor, I tired the neural network algorithm. Inspired by the model from OpenFace, I trained the algorithm using on the robot by my own. The effect was remarkable, though the pictures captured by the robot was of extremely low quality, the precision rate reached about 98%. Learned from the failures, I constantly grasped how to break the bottleneck and how to test the algorithms. Moreover, I learned how to think like a mature researcher from that experience, which was particularly precious for me as a sophomore. Besides winning me prizes and compliments, these experiences strengthened my information literacy skill, enhanced my problem-solving ability, and more importantly, made me feel the sense of achievement and demonstrated more knowledge I didn’t learn in textbooks. All the experiences are my precious life wealth.

 

In my spare time, I also took the initiative to participate in internships to cultivate my practical skills. After coming back from Australia, I’ve been working as a java development engineer in CRM development department in AsiaInfo Technologies Co.,Ltd[[A1\]](#_msocom_1)  until now, where I was mainly responsible for writing the database query logic and the development of China Telecom CRM 3.0 System. During this process, I found what a job needs is to apply the knowledge as soon as possible to ensure the software is in line with targets, which needs me to take advantage of what I learned to the utmost extent. Besides, I had a preliminary knowledge of the software development system of large corporations. Though there are a lot of things to do and sometimes I must work overtime, I could feel I was making progress in the practical abilities and was competent for the work of being a java developer. In the meantime, I was aware of my shortage in the knowledge reserve to undertake the work of higher levels. Therefore, I hope to continue to pursue the advanced studies, reinforcing my academic and research competence to a new stage.  

 

From the four years of undergraduate study and internship experiences, I found my knowledge in computer science was still elementary. And during the work, I started to worry that the tedious chores would gradually wear away my firm passion for the study of computer science and information technology. I also began to believe the continuous exploration and research of the deep knowledge will truly enrich the meaning of my life. After reviewing the website of your programme, I am deeply attracted by your well-directed courses, and hope to learn the road-based and leading-edge skills in information technology. Moreover, through your programme, I particularly want to combine the theoretical principles and up-to-date techniques in computer science and information technology together to improve my problem-solving abilities in the field of information technology. If admitted to your programme, I will try my best to lay a more solid foundation in my major, extended the scope and depth of my research, and grow more competitive in the future career market. Therefore, I apply for the master programme of Computer Science of your esteemed university. I look forward to being a candidate for your honored programme in the next academic year, please give me a positive consideration.

 

Sincerely yours,

Cai Yuxuan
