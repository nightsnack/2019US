# POLY U

## Master of Science in Information Technology  

### Aims & Characteristics

**Programme Aims**

This award serves as a bridging graduate programme for professionals from Science and Engineering background that may not be necessarily from the Computing. The programme is designed and structured to incrementally help students to build a strong foundation in core concepts underpinning IT. The knowledge acquired is further reinforced by allowing students to put into practice the concepts learned in class through solving IT problems in the form of projects. The specific objectives are:

- To develop areas of study in information technology relevant to the student's current profession or a profession he/she intends to engage in, and to update a student's knowledge in a particular information technology discipline;
- To develop areas of study in information technology new to the student or in areas not directly related to the scope of the student's first degree; and
- To provide an analytical in-depth study of an area already introduced at undergraduate level.

 

**Characteristics**

- It is a programme offered within the Postgraduate Scheme in Computing.
- Students have freedom to change the specialty and ultimate award.
- Flexible modes of study, i.e. both full-time and part-time modes, are available.
- Up to 15 credits can be transferred so that students can graduate earlier.
- Some subjects are included in the reimbursable course list of the [Continuing Education Fund (CEF)](http://www.comp.polyu.edu.hk/en-us/prospective-students/taught-postgraduate-programmes/continuing-education-fund).
